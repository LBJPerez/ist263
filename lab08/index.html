                <p>I'm an Information Management and Technology major and I’m interested in the cybersecurity industry.
                </p>

                <p>I have a 3.8 GPA and have been on Deans lists multiple times. I’m currently a TA for IST 256 (Intro to Programming). Hopefully I will be able to engage in many more opportunities down the line.

                <h2>Personal Information</h2>
                <p>Outside of school work I like to try out multiple new hobbies/skills. <strong>Every few months I try to learn something new.</strong> Some of my hobbies that I’ve been doing for a while now is DJing for 6 years and playing the guitar for 2 years. 
                </p>

                <p>A nice little fun fact about me is that I know a bunch of random information about history, sports, cars, etc. I’m known for bringing random information up at random moments.
